Man, I remember those "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" icons for HTML sites that were in the progress of being built.

I guess the "this is not finished, whatever" `README.md` has turned into that for me.

Anyways, there isn't anything here yet.

The goal is to get a template that creates a vuejs scaffold, and _also_ creates an electron-friendly setup in
one fell swoop.
